# coding-challenges

Welcome to my **Coding Challenges** repository! This is a collection of solutions to various coding problems from platforms like LeetCode. Each solution includes the problem statement, my approach, and the final code, reflecting my journey to improve my skills in data structures, algorithms, and efficient problem-solving.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal log of my growth in coding and algorithmic thinking. By tackling these challenges, I aim to strengthen my understanding of:

- **Data Structures**: Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Stacks, Queues, and more.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and other techniques.
- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Approaching problems methodically and developing optimal solutions.

## How to Use This Repository

You can explore each solution in its corresponding file. Each file contains:

- **The Problem Statement**: Briefly describes the challenge.
- **My Solution Approach**: An outline of how I tackled the problem.
- **The Code**: The final solution, implemented and tested.

## Future Goals

As I progress, Iâ€™ll continue to add new solutions, aiming to solve increasingly complex problems. This repository will grow to reflect my ongoing commitment to mastering data structures and algorithms.
